		<h1><strong>"The Story of Valrr"</strong></h1>
		<h5>The History of a post-modern, medieval planet of magic, monsters and gods.</h5>
		<br><br>
		<strong>Chapter 1 - Cause</strong>
		<br><br><br>
		This world was once peaceful, known as Earth, and we were once very technologically advanced. 
		<br><br>However, one day, something occurred. A terrible, terrible event, known as "Judgement Day". What we once assumed was one God, turned out to be multiple, as numerous titanic entities appeared out of nowhere in the sky. One was as dark as the voids of space, one shined as brightly as the brighest star, one was wise in appearance, and one stood below them all... a Demon. However, the one that caught everyone's eye, was the one stood high above everything, everyone, everywhere else. <br><br>The one standing in the middle began speaking, saying something like, 
		<br><br>
		"<strong>Humans, thou all hast failed us for the last time. <br>'tis  finally time for thou all to repent for thy sins.</strong>" 
		<br><br>
		Then, the gods vanished, beginning the Judgement era of humanity.
		<br><br><br> 
		<strong>Chapter 2 - Effect</strong> 
		<br><br>
		Humanity panicked, society went into chaos. Scientist quickly began rushing to build spaceships to fly us all out of here, but it only resulted in failure, as the worldwide economy crashed down on itself. Every government in the world also began crashing down, the military began blindly launching missiles in the sky as if it would do something, backfiring horribly as it all launched back down on other countries. The world fell into a huge war, destroying itself, slowly but surely. 
		<br><br>
		5 years into the war, the world realized, 5 years passed after the gods appeared, yet, nothing happened. Were we played? Were we fooled? Is this their form of judgement? 
		<br><br>
		The war stopped abruptly as soon as they all found this out, all governments of the world quickly going to peace to work together, to try and fix this whole mistake. 
		<br><br>
		However, the damage was done, the planet was in ruins, and it would take 1000 years to bring it all back. The modern era was over...
		<br><br><br> 
		<strong>Chapter 3 - Aftershock</strong> 
		<br><br>
		A decade passed since the war, humanity tries to put itself back together, thinking the problem was over, as the gods that appeared all those years ago have not made a single move since then. <br><br>However, just when humanity though they were back in the game. Boom. The gods reappeared, saying, 
		<br><br>
		"<strong>Humans, thou hast passed the first trial, but 'tis isn't over yet. It is finally time for thy second trial. <br>When thou art all complete, thou all shall find us, meet us, and bargain.<br>Maybe then, thy judgement shall finally be over.</strong>" 
		<br><br> 
		The gods say once more, as portals suddenly began appearing all over the world, as powerful monsters began coming out of them. 
		<br><br>
		The military tried to shoot them all down, and it worked. Monsters were falling down one by one with each shot. However, they also began getting back up, as humans also realized they all had multiple of each vital organs, and even got stronger each time they did. 
		<br><br>
		Humanity then also tried bombing them, but more and more monsters kept coming back out of the portal, more than what was even being killed. <br><br>So then, humanity, surrendered...<br><br><strong>Chapter 4 - The Return</strong>
		<br><br>
		We all went into hiding for the next hundred years, before rising back up another hundred years later. Humanity was back to where we were before all the technology, as we tried to redo all of our progress when in hiding, but due to the lack of resources, and how humans have relied too much on our own tech and AI, we fell back down and had to start from scratch. When we returned to the surface, we found that all of the portals around the world have closed, but monsters were now everywhere, and were exponentially stronger than they were before. Humanity knew we were ruined. 
		<br><br>
		However, one day, another thing occurred... the gods have given the humans, a chance to fight back. 
		<br><br>
		Humans all over the world began getting stronger, faster, and better. People could cast magic, and best of all, humans gained powerful abilities what we call, "Innates". These innates varied, from superhuman strength, to powerful unique abilities that only those humans can have. 
		<br><br>
		Humans started fighting back, with those who do being called "<strong>Warriors</strong>" able to even kill monsters with their bare fists. Monsters also dropped strange materials, some were nothing, so humans made them into currency, and another thing, which us humans called EXP(similar to video games in the Modern era), made humans grow stronger when touched, as they seemed to dissolve. Humans began making businesses with the new monster currency, which was stilled named Dollars($) after the most prominent type of currency in the Modern era, to help the warriors who kills the monsters; weapons, armor, equipment, sold all over the world as we all got even stronger and stronger. 
		<br><br>
		Humanity was back, in fact, humans got so strong, and were killing the monsters faster than we could ever imagine, the worldwide monster population fell by 5% in 2 weeks. 
		<br><br><br>
		<strong>Chapter 4 - Monsters</strong>
		<br><br>
		However, the gods didn't just idle around, watching this all go down. We passed our second trial, as the gods quickly began the third. The gods made the monsters evolve exactly as animals do. The monsters grew reproductive organs, they gained sentience, and they evolved, at a matching rate as the humans did. 
		<br><br>
		With that, Legends were born. Powerful, gigantic monsters that lived in a certain part of the world called a domain. These Legends lived in their domains and guarded them, protecting the monsters that lived with them. Monsters all around the world also began living in certain domains, to gain the protection of their own legend. And so, the monsters started the monster society, and humanity was basically at war with them. 
		<br><br>
		And all that, leads to where we are now. The planet was named Valrr by the new governments, who were once kids that loved playing the video games that we managed to salvage from the Modern era, and thought that it sounded like a fantasy game, and it was named after the word, valor, to encourage, motivate and inspire the warriors who fight for us against the monsters.
		<br><br><br><br>
		Legends state that someday, an entity from a world beyond our own will appear and save us from all the monsters, become stronger than anything our world has ever seen, fight back against the gods that have damned us all, and finally free us from this eternal torture that they call "Trials".

		<h1><strong>Guild Guide Vol. 1</strong></h1>
		<p>Welcome to the Guild! In this book, we will teach you information, tips and tricks about and to help you in your journey on this world!</p>
		<h4>Tip 1 - Rooms</h4>
		<p>In the world of Valrr, there are numerous areas called "<strong>domains</strong>". These domains are lands ruled by a <strong>Legend</strong>, and if you're a warrior, you're definitely gonna want to go there and fight some monsters to get stronger.<br>However, you may also notice that some areas have things in them, while some don't, well, these are thingies called "<strong>Rooms</strong>". Rooms are areas that are marked by previous adventurers from the Guild there to mark what they're for.</p>
		<p>Here I will be explaining which rooms are which, and what they do: </p>
		<ul>
			<li><em><strong>Empty rooms</strong>: </em>Empty rooms are, well, empty. They've been marked as previous <em>Battle rooms</em> that have already been cleared, and are getting ready to get modified by the government and construction team into another room.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Battle/Monster rooms</strong>: </em>Battle rooms are areas that contain monsters for warriors to battle, kill, and train in.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Ambush rooms</strong>: </em>Ambush rooms are old empty rooms that have been unsupervised for a long time, therefore monsters have inhabited them once again, and monsters even take advantage of it to ambush warriors nearby, hence the name. So be careful whenever you find a suspiciously empty room, it might just be an Ambush room!</li>
			<li><em><strong>Trap rooms</strong>: Trap rooms are empty rooms that have been set up with traps for monsters, however, some warriors might walk into them instead of monsters, so majority have been removed. However, some trap rooms have still been unidentified, so be careful on yur journey!</em></li>
			<li><em><strong>Rest/Healing Zones</strong>: </em>Rest rooms, aka Healing Zones are rooms set up by the Guild construction teams to let warriors rest and recover their Strength, stamina and Mana.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Shop rooms</strong>: </em>Shop rooms are set up by the Guild contruction teams for warriors to rest once more and buy items and equipment to help them on their adventure.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Shrines</strong>: </em>Shrines were old buildings built by humans from the Modern era to pray to the gods for forgiveness during the Judgement era. However, the gods seem to have answered their prayers all these years later, as encountering these Shrines and praying to them give the warriors who do a powerful boost.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Loot rooms</strong>: </em>Loot rooms were once considered "dumps" by the first warriors, where they would just throw away the materials dropped from monsters since they didn't know what to do with them yet. However, nowadays, people refer to them as Loot rooms as those materials are valuable to us now. Some Loot rooms even contain old equipment from past warriors who wandered here.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Casino/Gambling rooms</strong>: </em>Casinos, or Gambling rooms, are illegal rooms created by businesspeople to make some extra cash in the middle of a domain. These are considered illegal as, A, they didn't get permission from the Guild, nor the government to have this built, B, they could possibly scam you of all of your valuables while you're out here in the middle of a domain, leaving you with nothing while there are monsters out and about, and C, these could risk the lives of warriors and adventurers, as monsters still lurk around these areas! So we recommend you do not go to these places.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Legend/Boss rooms</strong>: </em>Legend rooms, or Boss rooms, are considered the danger zone of all rooms, as these rooms are where a Legend rests. Adventurers who go here either just came to look, the ones who marked the rooms, or are challengers who never came back out.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Cult domains</strong>: </em>Cult domains are another area that the Guild has no control over, as the Cult controls them. This "cult" basically worships monsters and treats them like the Greeks did to the Pantheon, offering and sacrificing anything and anyone they can get their hands on to hopefully "please" them in any way. Be careful when encountering one, and please report to the Guild when you do.</li>
			<li><em><strong>The Guild</strong>: </em>Lastly, the Guild rooms, where all of our establishments are!</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Tip 2 - Shop Stocks/Items</h4>
		<p>In your adventure, you might find Shop rooms or Loot rooms, as mentioned earlier, and in those rooms you might be able to obtain specific items to help you out on your journey.</p>

		<h1><strong>Guild Guide Vol. 2</strong></h1>
		<p>Welcome to the Guild! In this sequel to the original, we will teach you even more information, tips and tricks about and to help you in your journey on this world!</p>
		<h4>Tip 1 - Builds</h4>
		<p>In this world, humans have thingies called Physical Attributes, or stats in simple terms.</p>
		<p>Warriors can upgrade their stats through battle, as warriors consumes the EXP that monsters drop. Once a warrior consumes enough, they "level up" in a way, and their Physical Attributes will rise depending on the way they fight, their style, and how they kill the monsters.</p>
		<p>Popular builds that people train for are usually: </p>
		<ul>
			<li><em><strong>Vitality Build</strong></em> - In this training course, warriors would just focus all of their training on their Vitality. This is a very good build for the early parts of your journey, as enemies are usually very weak then and with your base offensive stats alone, you can take them down. Just use this build and grind for items until you reach around he 30th floor, only then would I recommend you start increasing your offensive stats.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Tank Build</strong></em> - With this, warriors would priorotize training their Durability, allowing them to take more attacks as if they were nothing. When it's great enough, warriors could become practically INVINCIBLE.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Potential Build</strong></em> - With this training, warriors would focus all of their training into their Potential. This way, warriors would grow way faster and way more than they need to. In fact, with this build, warriors could "level up" with only a single battle every time once their Potential has reached high enough, then they could start investing in their other stats and get stronger exponentially.</li>
			<li><em><strong>One Punch Build</strong></em> - Berserker-innate warriors usually go for this build, where all of their training is just focused into their Strength. With this, despite the enemies being way stronger than the player, one Attack should be enough for everyone in your way.</li>
			<li><em><strong>One Spell Build</strong></em> - This is basically just the One Punch Build but with the Magic attribute. This is much more recommended as Spells deal exponentially more damage than physical Attacks. The only problem with spellcasting really is that it costs mana.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Ultra Instinct Build</strong></em> - This build is better later on, when your stats are enough to deal with the current monsters that you'll deal with. Once they do, you should just begin investing all of your training into Agility, and soon, you'd dodge ALL of your enemys attacks, no matter what.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Sniper Build</strong></em> - This is just the Ultra Instinct Build but with Perception instead. Once your Perception is enough, you can guarantee Critical Attacks each and every time.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Millionaire Build</strong></em> - If you wanna grind money fast, this is the way. Focus all of your training into Fortune, and you might become a millionaire within the first 50 floors.(Tested) However, this is VERY not recommended early on, as you would get decimated with your "Level 1 Stats".</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Tip 2 - Monster Growth</h4>
		<p>In this world, as you may know, you grow stronger as you kill, all humans do. However, did you know monsters are growing too?</p>
		<p>Monsters in this world, aren't just braindead monsters that chase after you and crash into walls, no. Monsters are like humans, they're smart, they can grow, and they can evolve.</p>
		<p>But monsters don't grow stronger in the way you might think. Unlike us humans, that grow over time as we train and fight, monsters don't grow that way, instead, they grow in strength as new monsters are born. As ever since around 1000 years ago, when humanity finally came out of hiding and got stronger, the gods also "buffed" the monsters by making them smart, and allowing them to get stronger depending on the person that slayed them.</p>
		<p>When a monster dies, they don't decay, instead, they turn into materials, unbelievable, right? Well, only if you're not a warrior.<br> After that, the monster's soul is then reincarnated into a new body, which is much, much stronger than before, and it's the killer's strength that is added onto them.</p>
		<p>So basically, if the world gets stronger, so will the monsters, and if the monsters are getting stronger, the humans should too. It's a constant power creep that we just can't stop, and we'll have to keep going if we want to pass this "Trial" that the gods have set up for us.</p>

		<h1><strong>"The Story of Valrr"</strong></h1>
		<h5>The History of a post-modern, medieval planet of magic, monsters and gods.</h5>
		<br><br>
		<strong>Chapter 1 - Cause</strong>
		<br><br><br>
		This world was once peaceful, known as Earth, and we were once very technologically advanced. 
		<br><br>However, one day, something occurred. A terrible, terrible event, known as "Judgement Day". What we once assumed was one God, turned out to be multiple, as numerous titanic entities appeared out of nowhere in the sky. One was as dark as the voids of space, one shined as brightly as the brighest star, one was wise in appearance, and one stood below them all... a Demon. However, the one that caught everyone's eye, was the one stood high above everything, everyone, everywhere else. <br><br>The one standing in the middle began speaking, saying something like, 
		<br><br>
		"<strong>Humans, thou all hast failed us for the last time. <br>'tis  finally time for thou all to repent for thy sins.</strong>" 
		<br><br>
		Then, the gods vanished, beginning the Judgement era of humanity.
		<br><br><br> 
		<strong>Chapter 2 - Effect</strong> 
		<br><br>
		Humanity panicked, society went into chaos. Scientist quickly began rushing to build spaceships to fly us all out of here, but it only resulted in failure, as the worldwide economy crashed down on itself. Every government in the world also began crashing down, the military began blindly launching missiles in the sky as if it would do something, backfiring horribly as it all launched back down on other countries. The world fell into a huge war, destroying itself, slowly but surely. 
		<br><br>
		5 years into the war, the world realized, 5 years passed after the gods appeared, yet, nothing happened. Were we played? Were we fooled? Is this their form of judgement? 
		<br><br>
		The war stopped abruptly as soon as they all found this out, all governments of the world quickly going to peace to work together, to try and fix this whole mistake. 
		<br><br>
		However, the damage was done, the planet was in ruins, and it would take 1000 years to bring it all back. The modern era was over...
		<br><br><br> 
		<strong>Chapter 3 - Aftershock</strong> 
		<br><br>
		A decade passed since the war, humanity tries to put itself back together, thinking the problem was over, as the gods that appeared all those years ago have not made a single move since then. <br><br>However, just when humanity though they were back in the game. Boom. The gods reappeared, saying, 
		<br><br>
		"<strong>Humans, thou hast passed the first trial, but 'tis isn't over yet. It is finally time for thy second trial. <br>When thou art all complete, thou all shall find us, meet us, and bargain.<br>Maybe then, thy judgement shall finally be over.</strong>" 
		<br><br> 
		The gods say once more, as portals suddenly began appearing all over the world, as powerful monsters began coming out of them. 
		<br><br>
		The military tried to shoot them all down, and it worked. Monsters were falling down one by one with each shot. However, they also began getting back up, as humans also realized they all had multiple of each vital organs, and even got stronger each time they did. 
		<br><br>
		Humanity then also tried bombing them, but more and more monsters kept coming back out of the portal, more than what was even being killed. <br><br>So then, humanity, surrendered...<br><br><strong>Chapter 4 - The Return</strong>
		<br><br>
		We all went into hiding for the next hundred years, before rising back up another hundred years later. Humanity was back to where we were before all the technology, as we tried to redo all of our progress when in hiding, but due to the lack of resources, and how humans have relied too much on our own tech and AI, we fell back down and had to start from scratch. When we returned to the surface, we found that all of the portals around the world have closed, but monsters were now everywhere, and were exponentially stronger than they were before. Humanity knew we were ruined. 
		<br><br>
		However, one day, another thing occurred... the gods have given the humans, a chance to fight back. 
		<br><br>
		Humans all over the world began getting stronger, faster, and better. People could cast magic, and best of all, humans gained powerful abilities what we call, "Innates". These innates varied, from superhuman strength, to powerful unique abilities that only those humans can have. 
		<br><br>
		Humans started fighting back, with those who do being called "<strong>Warriors</strong>" able to even kill monsters with their bare fists. Monsters also dropped strange materials, some were nothing, so humans made them into currency, and another thing, which us humans called EXP(similar to video games in the Modern era), made humans grow stronger when touched, as they seemed to dissolve. Humans began making businesses with the new monster currency, which was stilled named Dollars($) after the most prominent type of currency in the Modern era, to help the warriors who kills the monsters; weapons, armor, equipment, sold all over the world as we all got even stronger and stronger. 
		<br><br>
		Humanity was back, in fact, humans got so strong, and were killing the monsters faster than we could ever imagine, the worldwide monster population fell by 5% in 2 weeks. 
		<br><br><br>
		<strong>Chapter 4 - Monsters</strong>
		<br><br>
		However, the gods didn't just idle around, watching this all go down. We passed our second trial, as the gods quickly began the third. The gods made the monsters evolve exactly as animals do. The monsters grew reproductive organs, they gained sentience, and they evolved, at a matching rate as the humans did. 
		<br><br>
		With that, Legends were born. Powerful, gigantic monsters that lived in a certain part of the world called a domain. These Legends lived in their domains and guarded them, protecting the monsters that lived with them. Monsters all around the world also began living in certain domains, to gain the protection of their own legend. And so, the monsters started the monster society, and humanity was basically at war with them. 
		<br><br>
		And all that, leads to where we are now. The planet was named Valrr by the new governments, who were once kids that loved playing the video games that we managed to salvage from the Modern era, and thought that it sounded like a fantasy game, and it was named after the word, valor, to encourage, motivate and inspire the warriors who fight for us against the monsters.
		<br><br><br><br>
		Legends state that someday, an entity from a world beyond our own will appear and save us from all the monsters, become stronger than anything our world has ever seen, fight back against the gods that have damned us all, and finally free us from this eternal torture that they call "Trials".

		<h1><strong>The Human Physical Attributes</strong></h1>
        <p>The human being, otherwise known as the Homo sapien, were once nothing but slightly more advanced animals. However, ever since 1000 years ago, humans gained many new attributes and abilities, which allowed every human to get stronger and fight back the monsters that rampage this world.<p>
		<p>Humans have 9 main physical attributes that can grow if they absorb enough EXP from monsters:</p>
		<ul>
        <li><em><strong>Vitality</strong>:</em> Vitality seems to increase a human's will, stamina, and basically, how long they can last in battle.</li>
        <br>
		<li><em><strong>Strength</strong>:</em> Strength increases the human's power, allowing a single human to carry hundreds of kilograms, and possibly launch a monster dozens of feet away with a single blow.</li>
        <br>
		<li><em><strong>Durability</strong>:</em> Durability allows the human's toughness to increase greatly. This also increases a warrior's ARMOR, allowing them to take more hits with more ease.</li>
        <br>
		<li><em><strong>Magic</strong>:</em> Magic allows a human to conjure up spells, and even use their Innate. However, there's also a thing called <strong>mana</strong>, which limits the amount of magic a human can use. The more magic a human has, the stronger they get, and the more spells they can cast, and the more mana they have.</li>
        <br>
		<li><em><strong>Agility</strong>:</em> Agility allows the human being to move around more easily, increasing their senses to, at some point, see in slow motion.</li>
		<br>
		<li><em><strong>Perception</strong>:</em> Perception allows the human being to also increase their senses, thinking speed, etc. Basically allowing one to "see through" others with their mind, find the <strong>weak points</strong> of things, and find ways to deal with problems quicker.</li>
        <br>
		<li><em><strong>Potential</strong>:</em> Potential seems to decide how humans grow. Some people have greater potential, therefore allows them to get much stronger, smarter, etc., much faster.</li>
        <br>
		<li><em><strong>Luck</strong>:</em> Luck is a unique attribute that humans once thought was only a concept, but has now been found to be real. The more luck a human has, well, the luckier they are. Finding "good" things much more easily, and take advantage of coincidence.</li>
        <br>
		<li><em><strong>Fortune</strong>:</em> Fortune is pretty much just Luck, but affects money, or something.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="contentInnates" class="content scrollable" style="display:none;">
		<h1><strong>Innate Attributes and Skills</strong></h1>
        <p>The human being, otherwise known as the Homo sapien, were once nothing but sentient animals with slightly more intelligence than others. However, ever since 1000 years ago, humans gained something called "Innates", which allowed humans to use powerful unique Skills, and have unique physical Attributes to help fight against the monsters that ruined everything. However, 40% of humans around the world still don't seem to have Innates, so they're just meant to live life in their homes, while others still choose to be warriors that fight for us all.</p>
		<p>Humans currently have 12 known unique attributes that have been scientifically proven that people have, with some, most people have, and some, only 1 in a billion have: <p>
		<ul>
			<li><em><strong>Tough</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are usually more tougher to deal with and take down, with them only taking half as much damage as normal people do.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Quick</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are usually a lot faster than others, think a lot faster, move a lot faster, and do everything a lot faster. So they're usually the most arrogant in battle, as they are basically uncatchable.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Reckless</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are usually a lot more wild than others, as people with this attribute rush straight into battle. Although they are known to be extremely powerful, they're also known to be killed in battle the most.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Berserker</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are known to be extremely powerful, with unimaginable strength, incomparable to others. They're known to take down waves of monsters by themselves, with their bare hands.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Arcane</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are known to be extremely prominent in magic, with them even having a nigh-endless amount of mana, being able to cast more and more spells than any others.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Hunter</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are known to be more silent, observant, and more critical in battle. With the natural instinct to strike from behind, these guys are known to finish battles off quickly, and silently.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Golden</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are known to... well, shine like gold. Golden people usually gain more of the currency material in battle, for some reason, and are also known to finish battles with a bang. These guys are also literally made of gold, so they are stronger, and tougher than normal people.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Big</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are usually known to be... well, big. They're stronger, tougher, and more powerful than normal people, however, with their size, also comes mass, forcing all Big people to be slower.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Fighting Spirit</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are known to fight until the very end. With a unique ability to get stronger as they keep fighting, people with the Fighting Spirit always make one hell of a last stand whenever they know they can't take it anymore, giving every Fighting Spirit warriors titles as Legends in this world.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Adaptable</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are known to be literally invincible. With each battle, despite being completely outmatched, always find a way around and win. Hell, they grow much faster than others too.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Invincible</strong>: </em>People with this attribute can never be killed. They're the type to run into battle and come out completely unscathed. People with this attribute are known to become exceptional warriors who will never fall in battle. All known Invincible-attributed people only died of old age and disease.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Relentless</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are similar to those with the Reckless ability, however, their schtick is that... they're unstoppable. Once they rush into battle, there is no stopping them, even themselves. The only way for them to stop is if they manage to mess up their own attacks, like missing.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Ambidextrous</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are usually very good at everything, especially strength and magic, using both with perfect synergy.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Reflective</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are known to be very reflective of everything; physical changes, emotional changes, and more. In battle specifically, they're known to reflect damage back to opponents, perfect for tank-type warriors.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Burning</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are hot, literally. Their skin is always on fire, and will want to spread fire to anything they touch. So usually, people with this attribute are very, very lonely, but are the most destructive ones.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Aura Farmer</strong>: </em>People with this attribute are known to be very, very cool. They grow exponentially faster than everyone else, and are known to finish battles sending chills down everyone and everything's spines.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Vessel</strong>: </em>It is said that one day, the King of Curses himself, Ryomen Sukuna, will return in the form of reincarnation into a worthy vessel. That day will be known as the end of the world.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Six Eyes</strong>: </em>It is said that only a few people of this world from a specific clan can inherit this attribute. Those who do have this attribute are known to be the strongest in existence, allowing them to use any ability they want, and basically do anything with absolutely zero effort. The last known person of that clan was known as, "The Strongest", but he died a long, long time ago during the Modern era in a great battle, but legends say his spirit rose from the dead, got corrupted, and haunts the same place where he died, still with the same power that he once had.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Immortal</strong>: </em>This attribute, as you can tell, allows people to live forever, and never die. It is a mythical attribute that only legends can have, in fact, it was theoretical until one person with it appeared, and changed everything forever. He is known popularly for this attribute, and that person is the head of the Guild himself, Gavin Andersonn. Gavin has lived for centuries, born around 600 years ago, he founded the guild when he was in his 30s, and he began the expedition to flag and identify every single domain that we know of today, identifying monsters, their physical capabilities and attributes, what they did, etc. He was also the first known warrior to fight a Legend and survive. He's also the one who created rooms in EVERY domain, ensuring that us humans could still find places to rest or live in peace even in such dangerous areas. Gavin is still alive and well today, of course, and is currently still out there, making more and more rooms for more warriors to explore.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Heavenly Restricted</strong>: </em>This is an unconfirmed attribute, in fact, it isn't considered an attribute at all. Only one person in history was known to have this attribute. All that people know about this attribute, is that you'll get unimaginable strength, even greater than that of Berserkers, but absolutely zero Innate, magical, and growth potential whatsoever.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Then, the one you've been waiting for... Innates! Innates are special abilities that were given to us by the gods 1000 years ago to help us fend off the monsters that they also sent to us as one of their "trials". Innates can do various different things, from boosting a human's physical abilities, to activating powerful attacks to decimate any foe in your way, but all Innates share one thing in common; they use up Mana, and a LOT of stamina. So you're gonna want to train up your Magic if you wanna use your Innates a lot, and be careful of when you want to use an Innate, since you can only use it once in battle.</p>
		<p>Many humans also seem to share an Innate ability, with some being more common in humans than others, and some being a lot rarer, with some only even being owned by one person, ever. Note that 40% of humanity also doesn't have Innates, but most still go to battle anyway, as most non-Innate users usually have very good Strength. But here, we will only explain the ones that have been proven to be owned by many people, along with SOME special Innates.<p>
		<ul>
			<li><em><strong>Rage</strong>: </em>This is known as "The Most Common Innate", as over 10% of all innate users basically own this Innate Skill. This Innate basically just increases the human's overall power, allowing them to rampage all around the battlefield, in exchange for their mentality.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Strike</strong>: </em>This is another pretty common Innate, mostly used by physical-type warriors, allowing the human being to land one powerful strike.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Blast</strong>: </em>This Innate is also pretty common. It's basically the magic counterpart to Strike, allowing the human to charge up their magic into one powerful spell to blast away foes.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Dash</strong>: </em>This Innate is considered a very good Innate, as it drastically boosts a human's Agility, allowing them to move around much quicker when casted.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Heal</strong>: </em>This Innate is very useful, and usually are meant for supporters in warrior teams, or by one-man-armies, as humans can use it as a quick way to recover when in battle.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Fireball</strong>: </em>This Innate is a simple one, yet very powerful, in fact it's more like a spell than an actual Innate. Warriors cast a powerful fireball that will incinerate anything in its path.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Freeze</strong>: </em>This Innate is yet another simple one, similar to the Fireball Innate. Warriors conjure up extremely cold, powerful winds that can freeze anything to its core.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: </em>This Innate is also another one like the Freeze, and Fireball Innate, completing the elemental trio, allowing Warriors to summon straight up lightning bolts from the sky to strike down foes and shock survivors.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Acid Spit</strong>: </em>This Innate is, yet again, very simple. It allows warriors to, well, have highly acidic and poisonous spit, allowing them to melt through anything.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Mesmerizing Voice</strong>: </em>This Innate is more like an Attribute, allowing people to have amazing voices, with main users of this Innate actually being entertainers instead of warriors, but is classified as an Innate due to it's special ability to manipulate its hearers to do what the user wants.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Hunt</strong>: </em>This Innate is usually used by Hunter-type people, hence why it's called Hunt, as with a single Hunt, you can deal massive, critical damage to an enemy, and weaken them.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Sacrifice</strong>: </em>This Innate is officially considered by the Guild and the government as a contraband innate. Anyone with this Innate is usually known to either be thrown in prison, or get told to never, in any circumstance, use their Innates. This Innate is rumored to allow warriors to gain extreme strength, in exchange for blood.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Counter</strong>: </em>This Innate is a very powerful innate for how common it is, and allows warriors to counter damage back to the opponent with twice its power.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Resurrection</strong>: </em>This Innate is known to be very rare, and users of this Innate are usually the greatest healers known to mankind, as they could heal anyone, even from the dead. However, if warriors use this on themselves, they're known to lose their Innate forever, as warriors can only resurrect themselves once.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Maxima</strong>: </em>This Innate is considered one of the rarer Innates, and is considered one of the most powerful, as only the most powerful Magic-users can use this. Costing you an extra amount of Mana, using this charges up 200% of a user's Magical energy, and obliterating anything in your way once you launch the attack.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Super Slash</strong>: </em>This Innate is also basically the physical-counter part of Maxima, used by physical-type warriors and blade users. When chanted, the human's striking arm's strength is boosted to it's limit, allowing a single strike, even by a hand, to tear through anything in its path.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Blade of Gold</strong>: </em>This Innate was used by a Legendary Warrior around 300 years ago, who, with this Innate, striked down thousands of monsters with a single blow with a golden sword, created by this spell by fusing all of the user's gold and Dollars into a single weapon.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Reversal</strong>: </em>This Innate allows warriors to deal devastating damage by transferring all damage dealt to the warrior back to the opponent.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Shining Armor</strong>: </em>This Innate was used by another Legendary Warrior around 200 years ago, who, with this Innate, was known to be completely invincible, infusing all of their gold and Dollars into their armor.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Switch</strong>: </em>This Innate is a very rare, ancient technique that has only appeared 4 times in the entirety of the Judgement era. This Innate allows warriors to unlock their "true self". However, only 1 of those 4 times was the warrior able to control their true self, as all other users would turn into a completely different person and go berserk.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Infinity</strong>: </em>This Innate is from the same clan that can inherit the Six Eyes physical attribute, in fact, this ability is so powerful, only those with Six Eyes can fully master it. It is said that at its full potential, this ability can completely manipulate space to its will.</li>
			<br>
			<li><em><strong>Necromancy</strong>: </em>This Innate is currently theoretical, as there is currently no known user. However, it's still possible to be obtained by someone in the future, and it's been theorized by people that; whoever does manage to find an Innate like this, will be the one to save the world, and return Valrr to the glorious Earth that we once were, or further! This Innate would basically allow the user to resurrect any slain monster, and make it their own soldier to fight with them.</li>

		<p>Name: Kyojiro Allista

		Height: 6'05"
		<br>
		Weight: 101kg
		<br>
		Innate: Unknown
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>This man has been charged with mass murder, mutilation, torture.<br>With an estimated kill count of over 378 warriors and warriors only, all in the span of 3 months, this man has only been slaughtering warriors who were adventuring. In the middle of battles, Allista would come out of nowhere and brutally murder them, and play with their corpses as if they're some toys.<br>Over 200 bodies of his victims were seen only near the forests, which is usually the first spot adventurers would go to. Some bodies were even found near the Shi Mountains, which is a very deadly place to be, indicating that this man is either a very strong warrior, or just en extremely powerful man with a special Innate.<br>However, when we captured him, we found out... he doesn't even have an Innate? When we left him alone and returned only a few minutes later to sounds of explosions and rumblings, only broken shackles and a hole in the wall was found.<br>Not a single trace of blood was found, and the way he broke through the walls and escaped the shackles was extremely clean, and there was no sign of struggle. There was no sign of Magic anywhere either, which only further indicates that this man was exceptionally strong.<br>Not a few minutes later, some of my partners called from one of our stations a few cities away, and they reported sighting Allista walking through the streets.<br>This man is a serious threat to society and mankind and has to be dealt with immediately.<br><br> Sentence: <strong>Death</strong></p>
